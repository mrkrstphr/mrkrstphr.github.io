After watching the commercials for a year or so now and being a cardholder for 7 years, I thought I'd try designing my own Capital One credit card. I accidentally closed the browser window while trying to close something else and thought no big deal of it; I'd just reopen it, right? Wrong. I ran into this error message:

<blockquote><strong>Oops...</strong>
We're sorry but it looks like you have recently visited the Image Card site. Please close this browser window and return to the original.

If you've already closed the original window, you will need to wait 3 hours before returning to the Image Card site. We're sorry for the inconvenience.</blockquote>

Eh? Wait 3 hours? I thought a simple matter of clearing my cookies would help. Nope. Still get the error. 

I have no insight into the Capital One code, but as a web developer, I can really think of no reason one would have to wait 3 hours to use an application. Seriously, just provide a link that clears the session or cached server data. No big deal. 

Capital One = FAIL. How about you guys lower my interest rate, too?
