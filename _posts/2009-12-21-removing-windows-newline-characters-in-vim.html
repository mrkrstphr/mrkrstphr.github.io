Sometimes when working on projects in both Linux and Windows, a file will end up with Windows newline characters, which show up as ^M in Vim. Annoying as this is, there's a quick fix to remove them in Vim using a regular expression replace:

<pre class="prettyprint">:%s/<control-v><control-m>//g</pre>

Magically, all the ugly Windows newline characters are gone.
