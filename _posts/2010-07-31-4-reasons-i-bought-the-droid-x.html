In my last post, <a href="http://blog.kristopherwilson.com/blog/2010/07/13/four-reasons-i-dont-care-about-the-droid-x/">Four Reasons I Don't Care About the Droid X</a>, I whined about... well, four reasons I didn't care about the Droid X. Open mouth, insert foot: I just back-ordered a Droid X. Bah!

So I present to you, Four Reasons I Bought the Droid X: 

<ol>
    <li><strong>Big Fucking Screen</strong> 
The screen is just absolutely huge. While I wish it was a tad shorter, and a tad wider (like the beautiful EVO 4G), it's still great. Initially, I was worried how it would feel in my hand or if it would fit comfortably in my pocket, but after using it for 45 minutes, I wasn't worried anymore. I went back and forth, looking at an Incredible and an X, and the Incredible just felt atrociously small after playing with the X.
    </li>
    <li><strong>It's Possible to Remove the Software Ugly</strong>
I complained a lot in my last post about how damn ugly the phone was, software and form factor. There's not much you can do about the actual phone itself besides dressing it up with a case, but it is much more possible to make the software look better by removing all the MotoBlur widgets, installing a 3rd party launcher, and downloading some other widgets (namely the Fancy and Beautiful widgets) to make it look more appealing.
    </li>
    <li><strong>HDMI Out</strong>
While it can only be used for viewing pictures and videos right now, I'm hopeful that someday it'll support being able to put whatever is on your screen on your television or monitor. Couple that with some Bluetooth keyboard and mouse solution, and I'm hoping this phone will eventually be my computer. 
    </li>
    <li><strong>It has the Bigger GBs</strong>
Okay, this really doesn't matter at all as you can easily upgrade the SD card in the Incredible, but the fact that the X comes preloaded with 8 GB internal and a 16 GB SD card is just boss.
    </li>
</ol>

So after my whiny bitching about it being ugly and locked down, I still bought the Droid X.
