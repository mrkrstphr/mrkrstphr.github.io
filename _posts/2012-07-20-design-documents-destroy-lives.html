Software development is obviously a young industry. Compaired to the longevity and history of home builders, lawyers and farmers, it is an infant industry. For much of the history of the industry, it has been dominated by development practices that first require a list of requirements to be drafted. This is a essentially a developer asking a client "tell me everything you need" and writing it all down.

Afterwards, the developer looks over his list, makes A LOT of assumptions, and then pulls a number out of his ass and tells the client "it will cost $N." For some projects, this is where the developer then starts writing code to implement the requirements. This is what I call running blind with scissors. Other times, the developer can get the client to bite off on a $5-10k design documentation phase where the developer will type up a 500-1,000 page document explaining every tiny little thing the project is going to do and only do. Then again, he flips through the pages, pulls a number out of his ass and hands it over to the client who either accepts or declines the proposal, and is out $N either way.

So what's wrong with this?
