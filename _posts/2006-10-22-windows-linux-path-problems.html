I had one hell of a time when I copied my Ruby on Rails application from my development  machine (Windows XP, Apache 2.2) to my production machine (Linux, Apache 1.3). I floundered through a series of errors and problems, but one error really stumped me, and unfortunately I couldn't find much help on the net for it:

<pre class="prettyprint">Application error (Rails)</pre>

It took me forever to get past this problem, but I finally figured it out. The first line of a few files in the <code>public/</code> folder contained a path to the Ruby binaries.

<pre class="prettyprint language-php">#!C:/ruby/bin</pre>

For obvious reasons, this wasn't going to fly well on a *nix server. So I had to change it in the following files: <code>dispatch.cgi</code>, <code>dispatch.fcgi</code>, <code>dispatch.rb</code>.

In my instance, it was changed to:

<pre class="prettyprint language-php">#!/usr/local/bin/ruby</pre>

But obviously your server might be different. Try exploring <code>/usr/local</code> and  <code>/usr/bin</code> or using <code>locate ruby</code> to try to find the correct path to Ruby.

After I made this modification the application worked fine.
