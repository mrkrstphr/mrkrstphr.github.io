In 2008, I took over development of a project called [Stjerm](http://stjerm-terminal.googlecode.com) from Markus Groß 
(who himself took over development from the original author, Stjepan Glavina) and, over the years, have slowly added
in features, as well as moved the project over to Google Code Hosting from Gna. Then I switched over to using a MacBook,
which essentially halted development.

Now, however, I've switched back to Linux and am looking forward to continuing development of the project. My first
big push for the project, aside from tackling some
[outstanding items](http://code.google.com/p/stjerm-terminal/issues/list) in the bug reports, is to add in a
preferences dialog that will aid in altering the options stored in the `.Xdefaults` file. It's something I've wanted
to do since I took over the project, and I'm finally going to give it a go.

Here's a mockup of what I'm planning to wet your appetite:
