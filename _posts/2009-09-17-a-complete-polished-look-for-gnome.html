I'm not afraid to admit it: I'm a fan of Gnome. I think KDE looks to cartoonish. I actually prefer using OpenBox with a slew of lightweight apps for window manager addons, but that because too much to maintain, and I have better things to do with my time. 

It's hard to find a nice, clean set of decorations for Gnome that mesh well together. GDM theme, icons, wallpapers, GTK themes, etc that all blend well together to create a complete, polished look. 

Recently I found the "Colors" theme set on <a href="http://www.gnome-look.org">Gnome Look</a>. 

GDM and Wallpapers: <a href="http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Arc-Colors+GDM-Walls?content=88305">http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Arc-Colors+GDM-Walls?content=88305</a>
GTK: <a href="http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Shiki-Colors?content=86717">http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Shiki-Colors?content=86717</a>

Nice and simple.
