I'm unable to add a second Gmail account to my Samsung Fascinate. Each time I try, I get this annoying error:

<blockquote>You don't have a network connection.

This could be a temporary problem or your phone may not be provisioned for data services. Please try again when connected to a mobile network, or connect to a Wi-Fi network. If the problem continues, call Customer Care.</blockquote>

Regardless of whether I'm on Wifi or 3G, and even though I can utilize other internet services fine, I was getting this error for days. Until I found the wonky solution.

<ul>
    <li>Open or Install the YouTube app</li>
    <li>Try to sign into the YouTube app using your second (third, etc) Gmail account, even if it's not a valid YouTube account. You'll likely get an error about an invalid login.</li>
    <li>Go to Settings / Accounts and Sync, then scroll down to Manage Accounts.</li>
    <li>You should see your new Gmail account listed. Open it up and change your sync settings to your desire.</li>
</ul>

It seems stupid; it seems like it won't work. But it does. Go figure.
