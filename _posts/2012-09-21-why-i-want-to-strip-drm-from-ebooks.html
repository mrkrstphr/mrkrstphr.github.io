I have purchased several books from Amazon for reading on the Kindle app on my Android Tablet and Smartphone. I'm still old fashioned in that I enjoy holding a physical book in my hands while reading it, but my growing bookshelf clogged with books I'll likely never read again have me rethinking it. So I've purchased a few books and graphic novels, and have read a few older public domain works. But I have a problem with the system.
<ol>
	<li>If I purchase something, I want the ability to do whatever I want without within my legal rights. If I buy a book from Kindle, I want to be able to open it up in Google Books and read it, or open it up in an open source reader, such as Calibre and read it on my computer. Because of DRM, I can't. I'm forever tied to using Amazon's services to read my book. And I'm forever supposed to hope that those services never go away and take my books with them.</li>
	<li>I want to make sure that Amazon doesn't randomly decide to revoke my access to my book. I bought it, it's mine, I want it forever, not until you decide I can't have it anymore. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html" target="_blank">This actually happened</a>, and Amazon had somewhat justifiable reasons to do so, but the users ended up being the ones getting hurt by it. If it were DRM free and I could back it up and use it elsewhere, this wouldn't happen.</li>
</ol>
The DRM is a problem. I understand piracy is also a problem, but we don't ban steak knives just because they can also be used as murder weapons.

Today as I was searching for a means to strip my Kindle books of DRM, I found several resources with comments blasting the author with piracy claims. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5733075/how-to-remove-drm-from-your-kindle-ebooks?comment=35523306#comments" target="_blank">One comment even said</a>:
<blockquote>I have no problem with stripping DRM for fair-use purposes. My point is <strong>no one is going to use this to take a Kindle book they bought and put it on a Nook</strong>, they're going to use this to pirate Kindle content.</blockquote>
Bullshit. I want control over my content. Is it that hard to believe that I would someday buy a Nook to replace my Kindle and want to read my Kindle books on said Nook?

I have no interest in pirating it. I buy my music, my movies, my books and software. I am a working, responsible adult. And fuck you for claiming the only reason I would want control over my belongings is because I pirated them.
