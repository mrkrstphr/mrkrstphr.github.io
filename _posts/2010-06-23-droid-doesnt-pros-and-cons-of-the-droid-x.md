The Droid X by Motorola on Verizon was announced today (regardless of the fact that almost everything about it was
already know for months due to leaks). Here's the skinny:

 - 1GHz Processor
 - 8gb internal memory
 - 16gb MicroSD included
 - 4.3" 854 x 480 screen
 - HDMI out
 - 8 MP HD camera with dual flash and 720p video capture
 - Android 2.1 with a new version of Motoblur

This sounds great on the surface. But why am I skeptical?

For one, it doesn't ship with Android 2.2, but that was just released today, along with Flash mobile 10.1, with
promises that it'll be rolled out to the device in "late summer."

But more importantly, the thing is just terribly ugly. The actual phone is just hideous, especially the physical
buttons on the bottom that stick out like a phone straight out of 2004. Just look at it's biggest Android competition,
the HTC EVO 4G. Now that phone is hot. Compare the two, and the Droid X looks like vomit. Whoever was in charge of
the phone design at Motorola should seriously be fired. You suck.

On top of that, it runs Motoblur, which is down-right hideous. Even the new version of it (from the leaked
screenshots), just look terrible, even compared to the stock Android UI, and especially compared to the beauty of
HTC's Sense UI. Come on, this thing looks hideous. You did the right thing by not putting that crap on the original
DROID (maybe Motoblur wasn't out at the time), why do you have to ruin a decent operating system this time around?

But the specs are absolutely phenomenal. The only thing I have to complain about is that it doesn't have a
front-facing camera (boo!). Other than that... HOLY STORAGE SPACE, Batman. I know the iPhone has up to 32gb, but
not the stardard cheap model. You have to pay extra for that. This baby comes with 8gb internal with an included
16gb card. NICE...

So will I get one? We'll see. When I'm up for renewal at the end of July, I'll have to stroll into Verizon and
compare the Droid X and Droid Incredible side-by-side and see who wins.
