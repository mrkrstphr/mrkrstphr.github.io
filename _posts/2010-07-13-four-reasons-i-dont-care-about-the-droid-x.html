I'll be honest: there are a lot of reasons to be excited about this weeks release of Verizon's <a href="http://phones.verizonwireless.com/droid/x/">Droid X by Motorola</a>. The device has some massively awesome specs: 4.3" screen, 1Ghz processor, 24 GB of storage out of the box, an 8MP Camera and HD video recording. Sounds great, but there are some definite show stoppers. 

<ol>
	<li><strong>It's Ugly</strong>
Let's just get this out of the way: the phone looks terrible. It looks like it's straight out of the early 90s. When you compare it to the beautiful phones rolling out of HTC, like the Droid Incredible and EVO 4G, this thing looks like an outdated hunk of crap. And while I know I shouldn't judge the phone based on how it looks, this odd-shapped, button popping monstrosity is almost too much to deal with. </li>
	<li><strong>No Front Facing Camera</strong>
Why does this matter? Front-facing cameras are a great new feature to a lot of phones rolling out (EVO 4G, iPhone 4), and for one very good reason: video chat/phone. Both the EVO and iPhone sport this functionality, but it's completely impossible without a front facing camera, because with a back facing camera, you won't be able to see the screen, and thus, won't be able to see the person you're talking to. Tsk, Tsk.</li>
	<li><strong>Motoblur</strong>
I know they're touting it as a new, revised Motoblur, but the damn thing still looks ugly as sin, from the UI to the widgets; it's just awefull, especially if you compare it to the HTC Sense UI. Even the stock Android UI looks so much better. This isn't a big deal, because you can just flash it with a custom ROM, right?</li>
	<li><strong>No Custom ROMs (yet)</strong>
The Droid X suffers the same fate of the Droid Milestone: an encrypted bootloader that prevents loading custom ROMs on the phone. For the average consumers, this doesn't even matter, but for tech heads and developers like me, this sucks all the fun out of Android.</li>
</ol>

I was dead set on purchasing this phone as soon as I am eligible at the start of August and was totally willing to deal with #1-3 on this list, but #4 killed it for me. If I can't install and play with custom firmware on an Android phone, I don't want it. 

Now I'm going to sit on the waiting list for the Droid Incredible and bask in the glory of a sexy phone, with custom ROMs, with a smaller screen and less than stellar specs. You almost had me Motorola; you almost had me.
