We've recently been interviewing candidates to fill two PHP Developer positions, and I've been astounded with the gaping holes in knowledge that just about all of the candidates have: 

<ol>
	<li>Modulo Operator (%)</li>
        <li>Constructor/Destructor</li>
        <li>Terinary Operator (?:)</li>
</ol>

These items are not PHP specific, and, while the last one might be excusable as some people frown upon using it, the first two seem like things that would be covered in programming 101. Anyone with a Computer Science degree (which most of these candidates had), should understand the modulo operator, and object construction and destruction. 

It's basic programming. We're doomed.
