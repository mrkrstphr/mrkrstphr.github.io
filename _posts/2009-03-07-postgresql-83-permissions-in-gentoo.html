PostgreSQL 8.3 in Gentoo now creates the socket in /var/run/postgresql with stricter permissions, meaning that regular users cannot connect to the PostgreSQL server via command line. Emerging this package outputs a message about this that I initially missed when installing:

<blockquote>Please note that the standard location of the socket has changed from /tmp to /var/run/postgresql and you have to be in the 'postgres' group to access the socket.</blockquote>

This means that regular users who need access to the PostgreSQL server need to be added to the postgres group:

<pre class="prettyprint">gpasswd -a user postgres</pre>
