It actually boggles my mind that I feel compelled to write an article expounding what, I think, are the merits of using a PHP framework, as opposed to just rolling your own code. But alas, after several rounds of interviews with candidates who either don't use a framework, or those who claim they have written their own framework, I feel compelled to speak on the matter.
