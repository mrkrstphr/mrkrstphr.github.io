I feel like a teenage girl the way I can't make up my mind lately. First I post an article on why the Droid X sucks,
then I post an article on why I bought it anyway, and now I'm posting an article announcing that I returned it on the
30th day of ownership. So why did I return it? Simple: Motorola is a dick.

I already talked about the encrypted bootloader and the eFuse, which are meant to cripple the device if anyone tries
to load any unauthorized firmware on it. This pissed me off, but I bought it anyway. But Motorola keeps throwing shit
in the face of Android enthusiasts who want to push their device to the limit and help improve the Android operating
system.

Recently, a leaked image of the Android 2.2 update found it's way onto the web, and immediately Motorola launched a
cease and desist and take down requests on the leaked image. Today they've announced that anyone who has applied
that update is screwed, and will no longer receive any OTA updates to their device.

You might be thinking: it's their choice how their software is used and applied. But it's my device, and once I own
it, I should be able to flash any custom firmware on it I want. Because I bought it. I don't care if the carrier
offset the cost by me signing a two year contract; *I own it.*

Compare Motorola's policies with HTC, who was in a similar situation: a leaked 2.2 update was installed on an unknown
number of devices, and when the official update hit, those devices were unable to update. HTC posted via Twitter that
they were working hard to help those early adopters (beta testers?) and very quickly modified the update to work for
those who had installed the leaked version.

So I returned my Droid X, not because I didn't enjoy the device, but because I strongly disagree with the policies
of the manufacturer, and would rather support a manufacturer that encourages and works with consumer innovation.

The Samsung Fascinate is about to hit Verizon, and I might just buy that, but more than likely, I'll wait for the
newly rumored 4.3" HTC device. Because HTC sounds like a company with policies I'd like to support.

Thus ends the Droid X saga.
