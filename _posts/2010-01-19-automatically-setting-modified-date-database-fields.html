Most of my database tables always have four columns in common:

<pre class="prettyprint language-sql">created_on timestamp
created_by_id int
last_modified_on timestamp
last_modified_by_id int</pre>

These columns should be pretty self explanatory. Usually created_on has a default of <code>now()</code> to auto populate it. Populating the <code>last_modified_on</code> column is a little more difficult, especially if you don't want it to be populated on INSERT (which is what using <code>default now()</code>) would do.

Of course we could just provide for it in our code, especially if using a trusty application framework that takes care of it for us, but I like putting basic logic in the database, and we can't assume all data updates will come from our application. They could, for example, come from a command line update.

I crafted this quick little database trigger function for taking care of this for me:

<pre class="prettyprint language-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auto_update_last_modified()
  RETURNS trigger AS
$BODY$
DECLARE
BEGIN
	NEW.last_modified_on:= now();

	return NEW;
END;
$BODY$
  LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';
</pre>

This function simply populates the <code>last_modified_on</code> column of <code>NEW</code> (the new record being updated) with the current timestamp. Now I can add a trigger to every table that has this column:

<pre class="prettyprint language-sql">CREATE TRIGGER auto_update_table_name_last_modified
  BEFORE UPDATE
  ON table_name
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE auto_update_last_modified();
</pre>

And now when updating a record in table_name, it will automatically populate a value for <code>last_modified_on</code>.
