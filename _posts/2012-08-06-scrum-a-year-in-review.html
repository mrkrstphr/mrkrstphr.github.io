Roughly a year ago, a coworker when to the <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/pages/CSM" target="_blank">Certified ScrumMaster Workshop</a> and learned all about the Scrum methodology. As soon as he got back, we began doing scrum on our newest project. We organized a scrum team, developed a backlog and started working 2 week sprints. It went fairly well: we were adaptive, we did just-in-time requirements rather than defining the entire project upfront, and we got the project done, satisfying our users.

A couple weeks ago, I went to the Certified ScrumMaster Workshop myself, and very quickly realized we were doing quite a bit wrong.
<h3>No Definition of Done</h3>
We simply didn't have a <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/articles/105-what-is-definition-of-done-dod/" target="_blank">definition of done</a>, which is a set of rules that define when a user story can be closed and is used to help generate tasks for a user story.
<h3>Poor Sprint Planning</h3>
...
<h3>No Scrum Board</h3>
We never used a <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum/task-boards" target="_blank">Scrum Board</a>. Initially, we used an Excel spreadsheet that we could all access and update. I, as the ScrumMaster, normally updated the spreadsheet every morning during the daily standup. Eventually, we moved to using Agilo on top of Trac. Using software certainly makes it seem easier and more convenient to use, but it has several drawbacks that we didn't really see.
<h3>Not Enough Feedback to Properly Adapt to Change</h3>

<h3>Useless Sprint Retrospective</h3>

<h3>Terrible User Stories</h3>
