I decided to try a rails project again... something I do quite frequently after I've completely forgotten everything I've learned. 

One thing I quickly remembered is that there is no easy way in a migration to create constraints, like a foreign key. You have to do some exec silliness with an actual query.

After some quick searching, I found this plugin: <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/mig-constraints">http://rubyforge.org/projects/mig-constraints</a>
<!--more-->
It gives you the ability to do this to specify some common constraints in the migration. 

<strong>References</strong>

<pre lang="ruby">table.column :user_id, :integer, :references => :users</pre>

<strong>Unique</strong>

<pre lang="ruby">table.column :username, :string, :unique => true</pre>

<strong>Check</strong>

<pre lang="ruby">table.column :unit_price, :double, :check => '> 0'</pre>

Very helpful. Sadly, like all Rails plugins, needs to be installed per project.
