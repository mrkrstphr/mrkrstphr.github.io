A developer named <a href="https://github.com/bwoebi">bwoebi</a> has submitted <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/438">a pull request</a> to PHP that would allow - in certain circumstances - previously reserved words to be used as class and method names.

His example shows a class named <code>List</code> with a method of <code>default()</code>.

This would be pretty sweet and has been, at times, something that has frustrated me when I've wanted a method called something like <code>list</code>, but had to go with <code>getList()</code> instead due to <code>list</code> being a reserved word.

The only problem with this implementation is that it leads to a lot of ambiguity and unintended consequences, such as writing a function named <code>if</code> and then not knowing if the one should call the conditional <code>if</code> or the function.

I'm very interested to see where this goes. I'd definitely support it in the case of Class and Method names.
