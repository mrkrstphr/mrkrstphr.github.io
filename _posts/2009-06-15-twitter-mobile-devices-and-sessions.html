I'm sure I'm probably the only one that has ever run into this, but whenever I'm curious if someone or some
organization is on Twitter, instead of searching for them on Twitter, I do a quick Google of +"their name" +twitter.

In my over-excitement of actually finding someone, I quickly click the link, only to find out that it was a link for
<strong>m.twitter.com</strong>, the mobile version of the site. So I get the condensed site. No big deal, just modify
the address bar and remove the m, right?

Wrong.

It seems that Twitter stores the fact that you're on a mobile device in the session or in a cookie. Because I still
get the mobile site... for every Twitter site I go to.

The only way I've found to reverse this is to delete the cookies for twitter.com.

Ugh, Twitter. UGH.
