title: The Insecurity of Security Questions
excerpt: Security questions that allow you to recover your lost password are inherently insecure or fallible, due to
    them being either too easy to guess, or too transient.

Security questions on websites where you have a log in can be great: they can help you gain access to your account
when you've forgotten your log in credentials. Unfortunately, there are some gaping holes in the types of questions
you have to answer in order to gain this access that could leave you unable to gain access to your site, or allow
others who have the adequate information to gain access to your site.

Some sites allow you to use your own questions, while others provide you with a preset list of questions to chose
from. And of course, some sites allow you to chose or create your own questions. There are essentially two types of
questions: hard fact-based questions and floaty, non-permanent questions.

### Hard Fact-Based Questions

These questions usually involve you answering some fact about your life, such as what city were you born in, what is
your mother's middle name or what elementary school did you go to. Those are hard facts, they never change, unless
your parents were lying to you, or you have a foggy memory of your own past. The city you were born in, your mothers
middle name (okay, she could change it) and the elementary school you went to are a part of history and cannot be
changed.

The problem with these questions are that anyone who knows you well enough knows the answers to these questions. A
close friend, an ex-lover or a rogue aunt with a vendetta could all potentially know this information, along with
your email address, and gain access to your favorite sites or financial institutions.

### Floaty Non-Permanent Questions

These are questions that ask what your favorite movie, book, song or band is, who your best friend is, what your pets
name is, etc. These questions downright suck. Do yourself a favor: don't ever pick them. Why? Because the answer to
the question will likely change throughout your life. Aerosmith was once my favorite band, but I can't tell you the
last time I listened to them, and only the almighty knows just how many pets I've been through. "Did I have Buster or
Puddles or Pepe when I created this account?"

These questions are downright unsafe as the answer will change as you move through life. On the upside, it might be
harder for those who know you to guess the answers to these questions.

### The Solution

Hell if I know. If I did, I'd probably have invented it and been on the cover of Nerd magazine. Picking your own
questions when possible and picking a question you only know the answer to might be the best way to go. Getting
ambiguous might be a good solution too, but you could get so ambiguous you don't even know the answer.

Another good thing is that most sites require you answer 3 or 4 questions, and it's far less likely your crazy
coke-addicted Aunt Marge will know the answer to all four of them.. The downfall is when they only ask you to
answer one of them when recovering your account.

Short of retina, dna or semen scanners that interface with the websites, there might not be a good solution. But
heed my warning: be smart when picking and answering these questions.
