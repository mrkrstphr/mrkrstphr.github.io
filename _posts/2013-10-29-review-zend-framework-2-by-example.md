Zend Framework 2.0 has been out for awhile now, and unfortunately not many books (besides some poorly translated from
German ones) have been written on the subject. I've recently read through a new option,
[Zend Framework 2.0 by Example](http://amzn.to/1dnTBVn), by *Krishna Shasankar V*, and, unfortunately, I still don't
think there's a good book out there on ZF2.

The book starts by going through a painful, screenshot-laden tutorial on setting up Zend Server in Ubuntu, even
though it's so much simpler to just install the packages through `apt`. After about 20 pages of setup and configuration,
the book finally jumps into talking about ZF2.

Continuing through the next nine chapters, the book then drags on discussing how to build an application in ZF2. While
I can't disagree that the reader will certainly have a working application written in ZF2 after finishing the book,
I highly question whether that reader will have learned anything and will be able to then go build their own
application.

ZF2 by Example simply doesn't explain anything; it goes through a series of "do this, do that" steps that gets a
working application on the screen, but never explains anything in any amount of detail so that the user knows
why they just did what they did, how to helps or affects their application, or how they can apply that knowledge in the
future when building their own applications.

There is no detailed explanation of how the module system works, just that it exists. Nor is their an explanation
about how the autoloader works, nor the a good explanation of the service locator, routing or event manager, which
are all pivotal, integral parts of Zend Framework 2.

All-in-all, this book is nothing more than a reworded copy of the free, publicly available Getting Started Guide
on the Zend Framework website, and does such a poor job of explaining concepts that the user will walk away without
any kind of understanding of what they just did.

My rating: C+. Skip it.
