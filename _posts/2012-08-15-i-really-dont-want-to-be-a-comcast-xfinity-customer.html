I've been a Comcast (or is it XFINITY, idk) customer at now at four different addresses, and my experience has always been terrible. A couple years ago, I switched over to AT&amp;T Uverse and never looked back. That is, until I moved, and AT&amp;T Uverse is not available in my new area. Nor are any other local providers (aside from satellite...gah). So I returned to Comcast, hopeful that things would be better.

I ordered the self install kit as I am a technology savvy software developer and figure "how hard could it be?" I hook the gear up and get no signal. I call to activate the equipment using the automated computer system and nothing happens. Still no signal. I call and talk to a real person, and they can't get a signal through. Enter the technician dispatch.

A few days later the tech arrives and discovers poor or no signal to my house. He has to run new coax across the busy road in front of my house and rewire the entire house. He quips that the house hasn't been visited by a tech since 2009, so things are very outdated. Seriously, 3 years ago and they are very outdated? I know technology moves fast, but three years should not equal "very outdated" and "no signal." Whatever. After 5 hours (literally), and the help of two more techs, he has my house rewired and services up and running. Phew.

Everything is working great except for one odd fact: both my computers running Ubuntu get terribly slow internet, wired or wireless. Windows 7 machines run fine. Even the same machine on a dual boot. 25 Mbps vs 1.5-2 Mbps. Wtf? Maybe it's an Ubuntu setting, I don't know. But I surely didn't have that problem with Uverse, nor at work (where we are an internet service provider). The internet just worked like one would think the internet works. Whatever. I'll figure it out. Apparently Comcast's internets work different than any other ol' internets.

Yesterday, after getting the service up and running, I checked my mailbox and saw that I had received my first bill. Before my service was even up and running. Fantastic. So today I got online and logged in to their website (using the account the tech had me setup while he was at my house), and it tells me:
<blockquote>In accordance with FCC regulations, Comcast requires you to enter your Security PIN and create a Security Question and Answer before you proceed. This will only take a few moments. Thank you.</blockquote>
Whatever. So I click the link to "Update Your Account" and then get this message:
<blockquote>Comcast requires you to update your account information at this time. Please chat with a Comcast representative.</blockquote>
Omgwtf? I then engage in a chat (after waiting 10 minutes for an available representative), paste in the two messages I receive, get passed off to another person, paste the messages again, and then she tries to test the connection to my house. What the fuck? Come on. Never once did I indicate a service problem, nor do I have one. I explain this, and she then forwards me on to the "Fix Team."

All I want to do is pay my bill, an act they should make easy as possible. Wtf is going on?
